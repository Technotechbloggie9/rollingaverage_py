# rollingaverage_py
This module was created to simplify the process of getting a simple moving average without maintaining the transactional data that it pertains to.
Additionally some features are available that emulate a exponential moving average when the right values are applied as a deviator. 
The python file is well commented, so feel free to look through it to see if it fits your needs.
